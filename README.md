* Extremely low quality effort, or non-full images (for example someone screenshotting and drawing on someone else's menu, measuring pixels, etc) were removed, along with some others.
* Memes were mostly kept, duplicates should've all been removed. 
* Done using Python 3, BeautifulSup lib, and urllib
* Some files are named incorrectly, for example "<filename>.jpg.png
